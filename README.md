# Introduction to xarray

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks designed to introduce users to the xarray library in Python. xarray is a powerful and flexible tool for working with labeled, multi-dimensional arrays and datasets, making it well-suited for scientific data analysis.

## Contents

The notebooks cover the following topics:

*   **Basic xarray - opening a dataset.ipynb**:  Learn how to open and load datasets using xarray.

*   **Basic xarray - subsetting data.ipynb**: Explore techniques for selecting and filtering data within xarray datasets.

*   **Basic xarray - plotting.ipynb**: Discover how to create visualizations of your xarray data.

*   **Basic xarray - calculating metrics.ipynb**: Learn to perform calculations on your data and create new metrics using xarray.

*   **Basic xarray - grouping and resampling.ipynb**: Learn how to group and resample your xarray data.

*   **Basic xarray - masking.ipynb**: Using masks to filter your datasets.

*   **Basic xarray - opening multifile datasets.ipynb**: Open dataset from multiple files.

*   **Basic xarray - Saving data to netcdf.ipynb**: Learn how to save data to netcdf.

*   **Problem 1 - Spatial trends in Australian surface.ipynb**: Solve spatial trends problems in Australia.

*   **Problem 2 - Calculate Nino 3.4 time series.ipynb**: Calculate Nino 3.4 time series.
